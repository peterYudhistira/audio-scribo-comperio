the magic of poetry is lost in exposition, but i can't help but break it down

-雷鳴 (raimei)  literally means 'sound of thunder'
- や(ya)　is a particle similar to と(to), a coordinating conjunction. the usage of  や implies there are other entities outside what is described. Also an article that finds extensive use in literature and minimal use in documents due to ambiguity.
- 鳴き声 (nakigoe) literally means 'sound of crying' note that the first character 鳴 is used in 雷鳴 raimei (originally a coincidence). 鳴 defines a cry as in a loud exclamation, as opposed to the commonly used 泣き(naki) which defines crying with tears.
- 響け(hibike) is imperative form of 響く(hibiku). Usually translated as "echo", but is more similar in meaning to "resound" or "bersahut-sahutan". Also personally a kanji that stands out due to difficulties practicing writing this a few months ago.
- 足下(ashimoto) is a phrase i just came up logically, but turns out to be a rather rarely used phrase. it means "underfoot", 足(ashi)--> foot/feet; 下(shita) --> under. The more commonly used equivalent is 足元(ashimoto), which implies at the same height as your toes. に(ni) is a preposition that means many things, among them "on" or "in". 

雷鳴や --> thunder and [...] | the second entity that is meant to be conjuncted is omitted due to haiku rules (first stanza must have 5 morae (syllables)), also quite a popular style within the four great haiku writers
鳴き声、響け！ --> [...] crying voice, echo!  | completes the clause on the first stanza. 
足下に。 --> underfoot. This is a common Japanese way of expression: attachment clauses ("keterangan" in the SPOK system ) being its own sentence. You'll find this style of speech a lot in mangas.

雷鳴や鳴き声、響け！足下に。| The implication being : let the sounds of thunder and cries of pain resound under my feet (because i'm on a huge ass mech and i am figuratively and literally above all of you fuckers)! 
(crack! boom! aarghhrgh! crackle! boom! my leg! crackle!)
